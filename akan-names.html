    <h1><strong>Akan Naming Customs</strong></h1>
    <p>Naming customs vary across the continent, and the Akan people of
      Ghana arguably have one of the most fascinating ways of assigning names. Unlike other cultural groups where a child or adult's names
    is determined by their time of day or ancestors, the Akan poeple use weekdays.</p>
    <p>Thus, the your first name is a reflection of the day your were born. In addition to indicating
      the day an individual was born, day names also offer useful glimpses into the soul and character of their bearers. So in this culture, you can judge a person by their name. The table lists feminine and masculine day names:</p>
